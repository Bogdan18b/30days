<h1>Build 30 things in 30 days with vanilla JavaScript. Thank you Wes Bos for creating this amazing tutorial</h1>
My objective was to improve my JavaScript skills by doing these small projects every day for a month.
<h3>Day 1(01/05/2019) - JavaScript drum kit</h3>
I built a drum kit, using event listeners and CSS transitions.
<h3>Day 2(01/06/2019) - JavaScript and CSS clock</h3>
I built a clock, using CSS transitions and a setInterval.
<h3>Day 3(01/07/2019) - CSS variables</h3>
I learned how to declare CSS variables and update them using JavaScript.
<h3>Day 4(01/08/2019) - Array methods</h3>
I finally figured out how to use reduce method and practiced on familiar methods, like map, filter, sort.
<h3>Day 5(01/09/2019) - Flex panels gallery</h3>
I am still struggling with flex, but I got a better idea of how it works.

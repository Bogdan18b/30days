<h1>Build 30 things in 30 days with vanilla JavaScript. Thank you Wes Bos for creating this amazing tutorial</h1>
My objective was to improve my JavaScript skills by doing these small projects every day for a month.
<h3>Day 1(01/05/2019) - JavaScript drum kit</h3>
I built a drum kit, using event listeners and CSS transitions.
<h3>Day 2(01/06/2019) - JavaScript and CSS clock</h3>
I built a clock, using CSS transitions and a setInterval.
<h3>Day 3(01/07/2019) - CSS variables</h3>
I learned how to declare CSS variables and update them using JavaScript.
<h3>Day 4(01/08/2019) - Array methods</h3>
I finally figured out how to use reduce method and practiced on familiar methods, like map, filter, sort.
<h3>Day 5(01/09/2019) - Flex panels gallery</h3>
I am still struggling with flex, but I got a better idea of how it works.
<h3>Day 6(01/10/2019) - AJAX search cities</h3>
I used the fetch API to get a list of cities, which I filtered it by city or state name using regex; and added some cool CSS transforms.
<h3>Day 7(01/11/2019) - Array methods part 2</h3>
I practiced a few more useful array methods, every, some, find, findIndex.
<h3>Day 8(01/12/2019) - Canvas</h3>
I played around with canvas; a flashback to the old windows paint.
<h3>Day 9(01/13/2019) - Dev tools tricks</h3>
I learned a few cool console tricks, like styling console text, asserting statements, logging warnings, errors, grouping elements.
<h3>Day 10(01/14/2019) - Select multiple checkboxes</h3>
I learned how to select multiple checkboxes when holding shiftKey, using vanilla JavaScript.
<h3>Day 11(01/15/2019) - HTML video player</h3>
This was the best project so far; I learned how to control the video player; most importantly, from now on I will change the playback rate on all the videos I watch outside youtube from the console ðŸ˜„.
<h3>Day 12(01/16/2019) - Key sequence detection</h3>
This was a cool small project, showing how to insert something on the screen when a certain secret code is typed; remember the old days game cheat codes (I never used them to get unlimited money or lifes in GTA or other games ðŸ˜„);
